The Community Film Workshop of Chicago opened in 1971 under the direction of Jim Taylor,  an acclaimed local black photographer. The workshop specialized in training people of color, particularly African-Americans,  and those who identified as from a disadvantaged background in 16mm film.  Proactively working to integrate corporate media,  the workshop encouraged participants to pursue careers in the local film and broadcast industry. They were a part of the Community Film Workshop Council, a national organization funded by the American Film Institute and dedicated to minority film training across the United States.
