Participatory Media interactively engages with and presents participatory community media from the 1960s and 1970s. Through the discovery phase, the project will explore how to provide access to community-made, rare, and often publicly-funded moving images and their related archives; provide a model for community involvement in digital public humanities work, specifically participatory archival, curatorial, and exhibition work; and employ innovative technologies to enable digital participation on multiple levels. The final product of this discovery grant will be design documents that include user interface specifications, technology requirements, and wireframes. The project is a partnership with the University of Virginia's Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH) and Scholars' Lab as well as Yale's Digital Humanities Lab.

We recently received a round of funding through the NEH's Digital Projects for the Public Discovery Grant. The team will begin in Spring 2016. If you have questions or would like to get involved please email us at: lauren.tilton@yale.edu.
